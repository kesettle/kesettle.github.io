# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is a way of visualizing and summarizing main points of the data. "What does our data look like? What does our data tell us?"

In EDA, we look for missing data, patterns in data, and outliers.
We might use various graphical summaries for a snapshot of the data: Boxplots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, heat maps, distributions. This will help us to see if there are errors in our data or if we're asking appropriate questions about our data.

It's also a good idea to try to understand what our data is and where it comes from, to see if missing data or outliers are appropriate to remove or not.
