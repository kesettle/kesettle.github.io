# The End

A reflection on the course:

This course has allowed me to "level up" in R. Before, I had really only used it for modeling in previous courses, which was pretty much my crash course into R. I was vaguely aware of the tidyverse before starting this path to learn more about data science, and now that I've had practice, it's something I think I would definitely continue to use if I continue on this path. Additionally, I'll likely continue using RMarkdown; I really appreciate the LaTeX support, and it's a conveinient way to have ideas and code together. While I don't know what I'll be doing after this course, I also think Shiny is quite neat.  
I think I would like to look into a career in data science or data analytics, but there's just so many options that I don't have a clear idea of what I really want to do. I definitely want to continue learning R, and I want to learn other programming languages and skills. I may continue learning and maintain what I've learned by using various resources such as DataCamp and Codecademy, the main challenge being self-motivation.
