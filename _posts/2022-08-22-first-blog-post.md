# Data Science - What is it?
The first time I heard about data science, I was a pure math major putting off my one required statistics course until my senior year. Stats isn't "real" math; I want to learn more about abstract algebra! But, of course, I had to suck it up and take it.

Before my senior year started, I attended MathFest with my university's math department. Most of my time was spent in the Exhibition Hall. There were a few government agencies attending, with phamplets and flyers on different STEM jobs within the agencies. As a rising senior, I had concerns about the future. What was I going to do after I graduated? I planned on going for a PhD, but then what? Maybe I should be more open to application. A flyer for data science caught my attention. What in the world is _that_?

From that point on, I was curious about data science. There are tons of online programs and bootcamps claiming to get you ready for a data science role in just a few months, but I really don't think it's that easy. Looking at various "requirements" for data scientists, what was asked for didn't seem reasonable, but I thought I'd start small anyway. Luckily, I actually really enjoyed my stats class; that was the first test if I was going to try to get into data science.

Here, I'll answer a few questions about what I think about data science and it's relationship with statistics.

### What do you think being a data scientist is about?

### What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

### What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

### How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
