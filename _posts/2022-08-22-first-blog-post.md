# Data Science
The first time I heard about data science, I was a theoretical math major procrastinating my one required stats class (for various reasons), which I took in my senior year. Before my senior year started, I attended MathFest with my university's math department. Most of my time was spent in the exhibition hall, looking at the different booths and employers. As a rising senior, I had concerns about the future. What was I going to do after I graduated? I planned on going for a PhD, but then what? Maybe I should be more open to stats and applied math; the academic route might not pan out how I want. A flyer for data science caught my attention. What in the world is _that_?

From that point on, I was curious about data science. I understood it was tied to statistics, but what made it its own thing? There are tons of online programs and bootcamps claiming to get you ready for a data science role in just a few weeks or months, looking at various "requirements" for data scientists, what was asked for didn't seem reasonable, and I highly doubt some boot camp would get you completely prepared for the role.

Here, I'll answer a few questions about what I think about data science and it's relationship with statistics.

### What do you think being a data scientist is about?
How I currently understand it, the role of a data scientist is analyzing large amounts of existing data to make predictions for the future, often used for decsion making in businesses. 
The best examples I can think of would be recommendations given in streaming services, online shopping, and social media. "Based on these things that you looked at, people who looked at those things also looked at these other similar items, and we believe you would be interested in checking them out as well."

### What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?
Data scientists need to have knowledge about math and statistics, and programming/software engineering, and to have domain expertise. They need to be able to get, clean, and manipulate data to analyse and use for modeling and predictions in a given field.
Machine learning is quite the buzzword for data science, but how I understand it, it's a lot of regression, finding the best models for data
There are a number of programming languages and tools that job postings list, either as requirements or preferences: R, SAS, Python, Tableau, SQL, Excel, Scala, Julia, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, C#, Git, GithHub, MatLab, TensorFlow, etc. I think I'd argue to get a good grasp of at least 5 of them. These are all tools to work with and model data. You can't do data science if you aren't able to work with the data.
There are also various fields a data scientist could be part of, and it's best to know about the field and the jargon in order to understand the business and the objectives, as well as so they can communicate effectively to people within and outside the field.

### What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
Data scientists and statisticians overlap. Both use statistics and analyze data, but the size of data and goal of analysis differs. Data scientists use large existing sets of data that may have thousands or millions of entries, with the main concern of prediction and problem solving. Statisicians use smaller scale data and data collection to analyze and make inferences.
The way I sort of think about it, data science is more business oriented and statistics is more research oriented.

### How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
Personally, I currently think of myself more as a statistician than a data scientist. As previously mentioned, I think of data science as business minded and statistics as research minded. At this point, I would say I'm more interested in learning about data rather than using data.
Of course, I have less experience with data science. Given more experience, and the right goal, I may end up more in the middle or even lean more towards data science.
