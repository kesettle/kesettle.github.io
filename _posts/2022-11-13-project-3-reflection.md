# Project 33 1/3

Regression! I enjoy fitting models and finding best fits. This project had us look at a data set and fit models to subsets of the data, specifically, two linear regression models, a random forest, and a boosted tree.

The unfortunate thing is that I had a few things come up during this project such as a birthday celebration and visiting a family member after a big surgery, so I had to travel in the middle of the project. It always seems to be the case that something happens during the semester's projects, but luckily the extension covered the lost time on this project.

The project itself was fine. I was a bit confused on the automation process, though. I created a function separately to fit models to each channel, but realized that wasn't the autimation process needed. Fortunately, my partner knew what to do, and we didn't have to sit through a long rendering process with the function.

I had trouble pushing and committing updates to the repo. None of my updates wanted to go to the main branch, so I had to either create a new branch and try to merge, or I had to manually update/upload files, or delete my local files and create a new project in RStudio. I'm not sure what the issue was; I didn't have this sort of trouble for the previous project.

Another issue that came up was the final data frame and model selection didn't print for each individual channel and had to be manually inserted. Running the code in RStudio worked fine, the correct numbers appeared for each channel when they were created, but for some reason the data frame and selected model didn't print for each channel. I also had to manually upload the graphs for each channel. None of this is really that much of a problem, just tedious.

As for what I'd do differently, the "nice" thing I think about is starting earlier. It's not always doable, though, it just matters that I'm able to complete the work assigned. I'm not really sure what I'd do differently. In some ways I wish we were able to add more methods to compare, but it's not exactly reasonable due to computation time. It already took long enough to render, but I'd like to do more comparisons. It was interesting seeing the channels didn't all pick the same model, and I wonder what would happen if there were more methods.
